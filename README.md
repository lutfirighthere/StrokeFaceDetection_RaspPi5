This project was orginally based on this project by owen kim:https://github.com/Owenkim2006/StrokeFaceDetection_OpenCV
I then changed it so it is 3d and has tongue based stuff and yeah it also it for raspberry pi 5. Also dont forget to update the stroke or no stroke im using a diffrent one the is private and i cant share
